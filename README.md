### Steps to Run the App

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?

I prioritized the performance of the app, particulary when fetching and displaying the necessary data components. I chose to focus on this as I wanted to ensure a seamless and efficient user experience for when a user is on the app. 

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?

I spent approximately 3 hours working on this project. I allocated my time by spending the first hour going over the project tasks, reading what's being asked of me and all provided information which I then used to plan out how I wanted the app to look and function. The second hour was then spent constructing the app in the IDE via code. I worked on setting up the data model and then using MVVM as the architectural method to efficiently fetch and display the contents of said data model. The third hours was used on integrating unit tests to ensure proper optimization. 

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?

I did not make any significant trade-offs. 

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?

I think the weakest part is the look of the project. I prioritized good functionality and decided to go basic with the look.
